# hangman-game

## Description
This is a game of hangman. The player knows how many letters a word will have. If they guess letters from the word, they will be revealed. If they guess incorrectly a line on a stick figure will be drawn, after 10 incorrect guess the complete stick figure will be drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses incorrectly 10 times (loses) or guesses all the letters from the word (wins).

This game was built using react.js

Restart and Help are buttons. Clicking restart will restart the game, clicking help will display text to refresh yourself on the rules of hangman. On the right of the page there will be a section displaying all of the letters that the user has entered on this attempt. It includes both correct and incorrect letters.

Underscores represenet undiscovered letters, the i is a dicovered letter. The text box will automatically enter any character added to it so be careful.
